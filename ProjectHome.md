Well, basically it's a Module-View-Controller system, kinda like Zend Framework, for example, but w/o the heavy helpers. It's only supports secure databasing (only MySQL for now), secure forms (with is also incomplete), secure variables (so as $_GET, and $_POST for forms), short and cool URLs and organized code.

It's easy to use, no installation required and I am sure to update and add more versions to this page.

If you want to help me, you might just contact me (eliran013 AT gmail DOT com), and I'll give you access to the VCS (It's Mercurial, for now.)

Thanks!
